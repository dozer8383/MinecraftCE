## The definitive port of Minecraft to the TI-84 Plus CE.
This project's goals:
- Working Creative Mode
- Working Survival Mode (with good combat and everything)
- New features from versions after 1.16 (i.e. Texture Update and blocks from Caves and Cliffs, Trails and Tales, etc.)
- Practical controls
- As faithful as possible to Minecraft within the limits of a graphing calculator

Not all of these goals have been achieved yet, but the majority are easily done so given the foundation I've laid so far with the existing code.
## About the Two-Layer System
If you've ever played Terraria, then this is basically it. It gives you the ability to place blocks on a background (which you can pass by) or on a foreground (which blocks you). This means that you could have a back wall to your house or be able to see the ores on the side of a cave.
## How to Play/Controls
- <kbd>2nd</kbd> - Select in menus, break blocks
- <kbd>alpha</kbd> - Build blocks (and eventually, interact with blocks)
- <kbd>mode</kbd> - Open/close inventory
- <kbd>stat</kbd> - Move cursor upwards
- <kbd>prgm</kbd> - Move cursor downwards
- arrow buttons - Move player (left/right), jump (up)
- <kbd>f1</kbd>-<kbd>f5</kbd> - Hotbar slots
## Inspiration/About this project
This initially began out of a nostalgia for the legacy console editions of Minecraft. I own a Wii U with Minecraft: Wii U Edition, and a Switch with Minecraft "for Nintendo Switch" (Bedrock, not LCE). I have to say, as old as Wii U Edition is, it is far superior to Bedrock in general. There's less lag, less bugs (many, many less bugs), and the C418 music plays all the time. I wanted to replicate that feeling, but with as many of the new features as possible. For that reason, I called this endeavor "Project Living Mice" after the Minecraft Volume Alpha song, which brings back the most memories for me. I fantasized that maybe, when/if I finish, one could relax and mine for diamonds and get their house blown up by a creeper and go hunting sheep for wool for a bed and build a huge mansion and all the little things that you experience in Minecraft on other devices. Why can't the TI-84 Plus CE have a game like this? I do feel like, though the previous attempts at Minecraft were cool, at the end of the day they were just really fancy map editors (personal opinion - feel free to agree to disagree). I aim to change that.

The roadmap of the project is beginning to take shape. Many things that I thought I would never be able to do, I ended up doing. In my mind, programming Minecraft logically follows progression of making Creative mode first, and then Survival. Most projects like this for the CE never made it past that first stage.
