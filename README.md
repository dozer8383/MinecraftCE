## The definitive port of Minecraft to the TI-84 Plus CE.
This project's goals:
- Working Creative Mode
- Working Survival Mode (with good combat and everything)
- New features from versions after 1.16 (i.e. Texture Update and blocks from Caves and Cliffs, Trails and Tales, etc.)
- Practical controls
- As faithful as possible to Minecraft within the limits of a graphing calculator

Not all of these goals have been achieved yet, but the majority are easily done so given the foundation I've laid so far with the existing code.
## About the Two-Layer System
If you've ever played Terraria, then this is basically it. It gives you the ability to place blocks on a background (which you can pass by) or on a foreground (which blocks you). This means that you could have a back wall to your house or be able to see the ores on the side of a cave.
## How to Play/Controls
